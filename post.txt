One of the best selling series in the world: Harry Potter.

Introducing us to the world of magic, this series is a large part of many people's childhoods.

I myself haven't read the books until recently, but I watched the movie as a child.

The story is about an 11 year old orphan boy, Harry, living his life with his uncle and aunt.

They treat him poorly, abusing him and basically treating him as a slave.

There is a sharp contrast between how they treat their son, and Harry.

However, weird things start happening around Harry, things that cannot be rationally explained.

Once, on a trip to the zoo, Harry is able to have a conversation with a snake, and then, the glass containing the snake's cage disappears.

This is an analysis of the first book of the harry potter series, of 7 books.

The first book is by far, my favorite, as it introduces the reader to the magical world and all that it entails.

The book is part of the top 5 best-selling books in the world.
Also, one of the shortest books in the seres.
